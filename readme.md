# ALTpothecary

## TODO
- [ ] compile one library with emscripten
- [ ] cross compile for raspberry pi
- [ ] make correct folders inside .zip in each library
- [ ] add license to libraries .zip
- [ ] make install scripts for all platforms (script? bash? python? c++? autodetect platform?)
- [ ] add more libraries
- [ ] add library with dependencies

## Apothecary Libs
Other than the natural complexity of a such large project things can be tidy there. some suggestions:
- removing variants, like bleeding, latest, etc. to the minimum to make libraries and scripts work.
- formulas: we now have some duplicate defines which turns hard to find and fix issues.
- we could have the global cmake defines, for all platforms, and then the exceptions:
- like the specific defines for each platform. This way we decrease the number of lines to work.

Apothecary actually clones compiles, packages, do a lot. Some of the repetitive work could be handed to some tool like Chalet, and concentrate in the right settings for each platform:
Individual libraries could have its own individual .zip files in each release and platform, something like:
oflibs-osx-curl.zip
oflibs-windows-opencv.zip

We can have an individual runner for each library and it takes in consideration if the folder was changed in latest push (possible in gh actions)
there is a proof of concept running here, the only caveat is this action to release needs a tag, so it is not possible to consider only the folder.

Another idea, we can keep a TSV with all libraries for all platforms, one per line, indicating if it is a download or uses a package manager, so this is a good way of choosing how custom the libraries will be.
example:
| lib      | platform | kind    | data                   | comment |
|----------|----------|---------|------------------------|---------|
| freetype | osx      | static  | oflib_osx_freetype.zip |         |
| freetype | linux64  | package | libfreetype6-dev       |         |
| freetype | macos    | package | freetype               |         |


```csv
lib,platform
freetype, osx, static, oflib_osx_freetype.zip
freetype, linux64, package, libfreetype6-dev
freetype, macos, package, freetype
```
